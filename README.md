# PreModel
All folders are examples of simulated data for different types of cavities.
You can use the inside .h5 files for data simulation in GprMax. 
And the .png are the images of the road model, the _B.png are the radar scan images.
DrawRoadStructure.py is used to draw the structure of road without cavity.
DrawDis.py is used to draw the different types of the cavities.
Lalala.py is used to simulate the detection process of the 3D GPR and output 20 channels radar images.
After installing gprMax3.0 and opencv-python 4.5.5.62, you can run the above code in cmd.
The gprMax3.0 is an open source software.
The yolov4_confid.py is the parameter of the YOLOv4 detection modle.
YOLOv4 is open source and can be obtained from the Internet.
